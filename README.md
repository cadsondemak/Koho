# Koho
The inconsistency Thai loop design given KoHo an unusual result. A Thai loop design for display purpose with a charm of vernacular and carefree handmade typeface. The design gives a flare of the unfashionable countryside and folk way of life. A touch of organic form was randomly applied to the head loop through out the whole set. KoHo gives a fun loving and sincere of Thailand’s rural that heavily based on agriculture. Koho was designed at a small design studio by the same name in KonKan Thailand aka Kham Chaturongkhakun, Kanokwan Phaenthaisong and Khanittha Sitthiyaem.
